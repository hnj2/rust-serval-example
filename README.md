# Minimal serval example for rust

To run this example you need to have [serval](https://github.com/uw-unsat/serval) installed and running as well as [rust and cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

You'll also need make (but I should really be using rust build scripts).

You can find the tests in `test.rkt` and you can run them with `make test`.
